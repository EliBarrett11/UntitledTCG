# Untitled Fantasy TCG

*Working title.* A one-player browser card game against an AI opponent, set in an original, dark-leaning high-fantasy world. Two players summon heroes and creatures into lanes on a war-table map, fight over Locations, buy Items from the Market, chase their Campaign Quests and race to 100 Renown. It's built in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript modules, one stage at a time; the design docs and the rulebook are in [`docs/`](docs/), starting with [`docs/00-START-HERE.md`](docs/00-START-HERE.md).

**Play:** https://elibarrett11.github.io/UntitledTCG/

## Play locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open http://localhost:8000.

## Run the tests

```bash
node tests/run.mjs
```

The layout check (needs Playwright with Chromium, a dev tool only), which also plays one debug match in the browser:

```bash
node tools/layout.mjs
```

The AI-vs-AI simulation (200 seeded matches; fails on any error, illegal state or stall):

```bash
node tools/simulate.mjs 200
```

**Debug view:** open the page with `?debug=1` (and optionally `&seed=N`) to watch one seeded AI-vs-AI match as a text log.

## Build log

### S0: Setup (13 November 2026)
- Repo skeleton: `src/engine/`, `src/data/`, `src/ai/`, `src/ui/`, `tests/`, `tools/`, `assets/cards/`, `assets/ui/`.
- `CLAUDE.md` with the working rules from `docs/04-build-plan.md` section 5.
- `src/engine/vocab.js`: every renameable term from `docs/00-START-HERE.md` section 3 as frozen constants.
- Placeholder `index.html`: a fixed 1920×1080 stage scaled to the window, on a candlelit leather table drawn in CSS, showing the working title (read from `vocab.js`) and "Stage S0".
- Test runner `tests/run.mjs` and `tests/smoke.test.js` (every term present, non-empty and frozen).
- Layout check `tools/layout.mjs` at 1920×1080, 1366×768 and 1280×720, with screenshots in `tools/screenshots/`.

### S1: Engine core (13 November 2026)
- The full rulebook (sections 1–11) in `src/engine/game.js`: Rounds (Dawn, the Battle Phase, Dusk in the rulebook's order), initiative, the Pass rules, the mulligan; Energy, Exert and Exhaust (`energy.js`); Levels, the summon snapshot, costs and Legendary cards; Ready and Spent, attacks, hitting back, Shield and Ward (with the Warlord rule), defeat and the Released Pile; Renown from every source and both win conditions; Retain, Events, Actions (React, Adapt and Strat, with the React window as engine state); Items, Gold, the Bag and the Market; Locations; Campaigns, Quests and Legendary Creatures; the Last Battle.
- Section 12's machinery: a trigger queue with chains capped at 4, keywords that add up from different sources, and a plain effect vocabulary (`abilities.js`). The approved keyword and trigger lists are empty.
- One entry point, `applyAction(state, action)`, and `legalActions(state, player)`, which lists every legal action fully specified. Deterministic from a seed.
- Placeholder cards and a legal 40-card placeholder deck in `src/data/placeholder.js`.
- The AI (`src/ai/ai.js`): a greedy one-move player that acts only through `legalActions` and `applyAction`, never sees hidden information, and is seeded.
- Tests: one file per rulebook section (`tests/rules-*.test.js`), plus the engine contract, the AI and a short simulation.
- `tools/simulate.mjs`: 200 seeded AI-vs-AI matches with no errors or stalls.
- A debug view (`?debug=1`) that plays one seeded AI-vs-AI match in the browser as a text log.
- Vocabulary: "Legendary Hero" is now "Legendary Creature"; Traits, Race and Races added; Classes confirmed.
- Readings that need Elliott's approval are listed in `docs/01-rulebook.md` section 13.
